WHAT IS "Brewfest?"
Brewfest is a rowdy celebration featuring large festival camps set up outside of Orgrimmar and Ironforge, with smaller camps set outside of each major city. At the main camps, players will find quests, vendors, and everflowing kegs of brew! World of Warcraft's Brewfest is an in-game version of the Bavarian fair Oktoberfest, complete with its own special festival music and activies.
